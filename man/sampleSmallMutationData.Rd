\title{Cancer Base Subtitution Data
\code{sampleSmallMutationData}
Describes the frequencies of the 96 possible mutations for multiple different types of cancer.
Since each mutation can be described as (C>A, C>G, C>T, T>A, T>C, T>G), by taking the one immediately preceding and after, we get 96 possibilities.
There are 25 cancer types, with 5 samples for each cancer type. Please see \code{./inst/scripts/generateExtData.R} to see how it was generated.}
\format{An RData file with 96 rows and 135 columns (27 * 5):
\describe{
  \item{A,C>A,A}{represents the C to A mutation, as well as the surrounding bases}
  \item{A,C>A,C}{represents the same mutation with different surrounding bases}
